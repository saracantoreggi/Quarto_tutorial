In this project we aim to visualize the trends of the most frequently used baby names from 1880 to 2017 in the United States. We do this by:

-   Understanding the different columns of the data set

-   Find the top 10 most frequently used baby names in the data for:

    -   girls

    -   boys

-   Plot the yearly trend of the top 10 baby names
